                    <p>A C++ implementation of generalized network algorithms. Developed for a Spring 2018 course called <i>Algorithms for Complex Networks</i>. Efficiently implemented a suite of network analytics statistics and procedures. Suite includes various centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, <i>k</i>-core), assortativity, search algorithms, and more. </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>Third place winner in UVM 2017 Computer Science fair. Implemented an artificially intelligent reinforcement learning agent and trained it to play a simplified version of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game"><i>Asteroids</i></a> game. The game was developed in C++ and the AI system was implemented using Tensorflow and other selected python libraries. Final DNN architecture was a modified version of the Deep Q-Network, a tested convolutional architecture that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">Q-learning algorithm</a>.</p>
